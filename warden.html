				<h1>The Magicka Warden sucks</h1>
				Since its conception the Warden class in ESO has received a lot of flack for underperforming in the DPS department. To this day it's unfortunately still true.<br>
				Out of all the classes it's definitely bottom tier when it comes to consistent damage in both PVP, and PVE.

				<h2>Why does it suck so much?</h2>
				The Magicka Warden has some conflicting abilities. The only 2 main DD skills you have at your disposal are <strong>Screaming Cliff Racer</strong> and <strong>Deep Fissure</strong>. They are conflicting because Deep Fissure, which you want to apply whenever it has completed its attack, has a restrictive range, yet Screaming Cliff Racer gives you bonus damage at longer ranges.<br>
				This means you can never really be too far away from your target or you're missing out on significant DPS and debuffs from Fissure. At long range you're basically a Sorcerer with less shields, less mobility, no curse, no crystal fragments, and no execute. You're useless.<br>
				In my testing the destruction staff ability <strong>Crushing Shock</strong> performed 4% better than Screaming Cliff Racer, and not only that, but it can apply elemental status effects, AND interrupt an enemy from range. It's just all-round better.<br>
				Another drawback they have is their DoT. <strong>Fetcher Infection</strong>, while strong, requires two casts to get the most out of it. This significantly slows down your rotation and puts you at risk while casting. Most of the Warden toolkit feels somewhat clunky to use, and fetcher is definitely no exception.<br>
				One other problem you may run into with Magicka Warden is closing kills. With terrible sustained damage and zero execute, you'll find it difficult finishing targets off. By the time you've rebuffed yourself they are already at 80% health again and you're back to square one. It's truly demoralizing.

				<h2>But bro, it can tank and heal</h2>
				Warden is second to Templar in terms of healing, and second to the DK for tanking, and last at damage. Playing as a Warden you're pigeon-holed into off-tanking, or healing, because that's all they really excel at. Classes should be great at one thing, or be at least efficient at everything. For example, the Sorcerer is not known for being a very good tank, but in terms of damage they are up there with Nightblades.
			</p>

				<h2>Low tier, but continuously nerfed</h2>
				Even with massive complaints from the Warden players, it seems to be getting nerfed on a regular basis.
				Cliff Racer can now be dodged. This is huge. With its slow animation it's being dodged in PVP effortlessly, as if your DPS wasn't bad enough.<br>
				Crystalized Shield's cost was increased. Warden buffs are already expensive enough as it is. Sure, this ability returns magicka when hit, but you're taking a risk casting it knowing you may not even get shot at.<br>
				Deep Fissure no longer applies a stun. For PVP this was a huge nerf. The Warden has no real CC. Deep Fissure was the only way we could stun someone to get pressure off, or prepare a combo. This ability is already easily dodged by simply moving out of the way. Now I agree with ZOS that no ability should provide high damage while CCing, but an exception must be made considering it was Warden's only proper CC, and how hard it is to hit a specific target with this skill.<br>
				Why this class is getting nerfed instead of buffed is completely beyond me.

				<h2>The Bear ultimate</h2>
				What would have been better is something like a Selene proc, where a giant bear momentarily appears to rip anything in front of it apart.
				Instead we received a useless pet that needs to be double-barred, performs easily predicted attacks, can be CCd and killed quickly. It's a complete waste. Fortunately the other 2 ultimates are perfectly fine as they are.
			</p>

				<h2>What would I like to see?</h2>
				Honestly I don't believe Magicka Warden needs a lot. Just a bit more damage would be nice. I never understood why a class so heavily revolved around ice attacks by throwing birds at people. I'd rather throw ice shards that deal frost damage, and shoot horizontally instead of coming from the sky.<br>
				Fetcher Infection morph should be a single cast. Why do other abilities deal more damage with a particular morph, yet ours requires a second cast in order to reap the benefits?<br>
				Perhaps a morph of frozen gate could create a shield of ice from the ground infront of you, or allow you to teleport to the circled location (increasing in magicka consumption as per streak).<br>
				With the fetcher and ice shard implementation they may not require an execute, but if not, at least give them an execute of some kind. Maybe change the increased damage from Screaming Cliff Racer to increased damage to low health targets.<br>
				These are the only changes at present I would make to the Warden. While few in number, they would make a big deal to playing Magicka Warden, and help be more viable in DPS
